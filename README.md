TeslaMate to ABRP bridge - Home Assistant addon

A Home Assistant addon which exports Tesla data from a TeslaMate install to A Better Route Planner (ABRP).

This is just a Home Assistant wrapper for the existing existing Python script which does the export at https://github.com/fetzu/teslamate-abrp

Requires a working Home Assistant instance with TeslaMate addons enabled.

Experimental but seems to work in my install.
